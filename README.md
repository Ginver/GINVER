### Hi there!

### After a couple of years working in the fashion industry as a product developer & coordinator I've become more and more interested in the tech industry. About a year ago I decided to learn frontend development and got very much attracted to it. 

### I am strong in finding new and creative solutions to problems, successful at implementing new strategies, designs and bringing detail-oriented work to any project. I enjoy acquire new knowledge and developing new skills with great enthusiasm to quickly perform my tasks independently. I do all this with a smile and I always try to create a good working atmosphere around me.

### I am currently looking for an opportunity in frontend development where I can further develop myself in this area, where I feel socially involved and my efforts are appreciated.
