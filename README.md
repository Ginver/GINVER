##### After working for several years in the fashion industry as a product developer & coordinator I've become more and more interested in the tech industry. After some time I decided to feed my curiosity and went to learn frontend development - since I got very much hooked on it.

##### I've been learning modern front-end development - Single Page Apps with React & APIs, building and understanding apps from scratch and experiencing the entire design process through a final assignment. 

##### In the year of 2022 I was on a maternity leave. 

##### At the moment: I continue my journey and my development gaining more and more experience by practicing to make “pixel perfect” CSS designs based on professional Figma designs and complete frontend challenges. 

##### On my to-do list: Server Side Rendering with Next.js & Connecting CMS systems to my apps.

##### My soft skills: I am strong in finding new and creative solutions to problems, successful at implementing new strategies, designs and bringing detail-oriented work to any project. I enjoy acquiring new knowledge and developing new skills with great enthusiasm to quickly perform my tasks independently. I do all this with a smile and I always try to create a good working atmosphere around me.

##### I am currently looking for an opportunity in frontend development where I can further develop myself in this area, where I feel socially involved and my efforts are appreciated. So take a look at my profile, give suggestions on how to get better OR get in touch!
