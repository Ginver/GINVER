##### After a couple of years working in the fashion industry as a product developer & coordinator I've become more and more interested in the tech industry. About a year ago I decided to learn frontend development and got very much hooked on it.

##### Since last year: I've been learning modern front-end development - Single Page Apps with React & APIs. Building and understanding apps from scratch and experiencing the entire design process through a final assignment. 
##### At the moment: I am continuing my development and trying to gain more and more experience by practicing a lot to make “pixel perfect” CSS designs based on professional Figma designs. 
##### On my to-do list: Server Side Rendering with Next.js & Connecting CMS systems to my apps

##### I am strong in finding new and creative solutions to problems, successful at implementing new strategies, designs and bringing detail-oriented work to any project. I enjoy acquiring new knowledge and developing new skills with great enthusiasm to quickly perform my tasks independently. I do all this with a smile and I always try to create a good working atmosphere around me.

##### I am currently looking for an opportunity in frontend development where I can further develop myself in this area, where I feel socially involved and my efforts are appreciated.
